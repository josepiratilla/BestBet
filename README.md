# BestBet
A exercise about probabilities and stochastic simulation.

Imagine a game where you can select the bet and you know the probability you have to win. You pay that game multiple times. What is the best strategy for betting?

For instance, if you have a 60% chance of winning, and you start with 100â‚¬, if you always play all your money, the chances of loosing everything are high. If you always play 10 % of the money you have, you'll win money at the end. But, Is it better to always play 20%, or 40%. 

The code simulates multiple rounds of playing, and checks the different probabilities to return the best one.
